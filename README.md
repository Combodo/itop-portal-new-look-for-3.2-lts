# iTop module: Portal new look for 3.2 LTS

## About

The interface has been completely redesigned to be more modern and user-friendly, aligning perfectly with the consoleâ€™s interface.

You can change its apparence, colors, change the main menu orientation

Note This portal new version will be integred in iTop 3.3. and is only compatible with iTop 3.2.1 minimum.


## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the best way to get a running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you will miss additional modules.
